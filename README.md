From The Odin Project's Web Development 101 Course. (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/rock-paper-scissors)

I tried to keep all components as simple and as separate as possible. Overall, it works and fulfills requirements but it could use user input validation, better score keeping (I'm not certain on loops yet) and interpolated console messages. Also, there is likely a better way to share the "winner" variable amongst functions but I'm not there yet.
